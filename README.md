# Letter-Management-System

Windows Application built with Qt Creator.

Created on 15/02/2018.
## App Use

I built this app while I'm in Vocational High School 11 grade. Percisely while I'm doing "field work practice" I submit a proposal to built this app to my boss because at that time the management of letters in my office was still done manually with log book.
